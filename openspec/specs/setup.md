# Spec: setup.sh — Interactive Installer

## Description

The setup script is the entry point for new users. It guides them through an
interactive 11-step process to configure their wiki, create initial pages (Schema,
Dashboard, Hub pages), generate the config file, and optionally install the /llm-wiki
skill for Claude Code. It requires only bash, python3, and git.

---

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

- REQ-700: The system MUST require bash (any version supporting `read -p`).
- REQ-701: The system MUST require python3. If python3 is not available, the
  system SHALL display an error and exit.
- REQ-702: The system MUST require git for the optional git init step.
  If git is not available, git-related steps SHALL be skipped with a warning.
- REQ-703: The system MUST NOT require any package manager (npm, pip, etc.)
  or any installed libraries beyond the standard library.

### Step 1: Tool Selection

- REQ-710: The system SHALL prompt the user to choose between Logseq (1) and
  Obsidian (2).
- REQ-711: If the user enters a value other than 1 or 2, the system SHALL
  display an error and exit.
- REQ-712: The tool choice determines ALL downstream behavior: file naming,
  property syntax, directory structure, template selection.

### Step 2: Wiki Path

- REQ-720: The system SHALL prompt for the wiki/vault root path with a
  tool-specific default (`~/Documents/Logseq` or `~/Documents/ObsidianVault`).
- REQ-721: The system SHALL expand `~` to `$HOME` in the provided path.
- REQ-722: If the path does not exist, the system SHALL ask "Create it? [y/n]".
  On "y": create with `mkdir -p`. On "n": exit with error.

### Step 3: Pages Directory

- REQ-730: For Logseq, `pages_dir` SHALL be set to `pages`.
  For Obsidian, `pages_dir` SHALL be set to empty string.
- REQ-731: If the pages directory does not exist, the system SHALL create it
  with `mkdir -p`.

### Step 4: Namespaces

- REQ-740: The system SHALL offer a default namespace list:
  Business, Tech, Content, Projects, People, Learning, Reference.
- REQ-741: The user MAY enter a custom space-separated list or press Enter
  to accept defaults.
- REQ-742: Namespace names SHOULD be single words in Title Case. The system
  does not validate this (user responsibility).

### Step 5: Memory Path

- REQ-750: The system SHALL prompt for the Claude Code memory directory path.
- REQ-751: The user MAY skip this step. If skipped, `memory_path` is empty
  in the generated config.
- REQ-752: The system SHALL expand `~` to `$HOME` in the provided path.
- REQ-753: The system does NOT validate that the memory path exists (it may
  be created later by Claude Code).

### Step 6: Git Init

- REQ-760: If the wiki directory does not have a `.git` directory, the system
  SHALL ask "Initialize git? [y/n]".
- REQ-761: On "y": run `git init`, create tool-specific `.gitignore`.
- REQ-762: Logseq `.gitignore` SHALL include: `logseq/bak/`, `logseq/.recycle/`,
  `.DS_Store`, `.logseq/`.
- REQ-763: Obsidian `.gitignore` SHALL include: `.obsidian/workspace.json`,
  `.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json`, `.DS_Store`, `.trash/`.
- REQ-764: On "n": skip git initialization entirely.
- REQ-765: If `.git` already exists, skip this step silently.

### Step 7: Template Validation

- REQ-770: The system SHALL locate the template directory at
  `$SCRIPT_DIR/templates/$TOOL/`.
- REQ-771: If the template directory does not exist, the system SHALL display
  an error and exit.

### Step 8: Page Creation (Python Template Rendering)

- REQ-780: The system SHALL use python3 to render templates with variable
  substitution.
- REQ-781: Template variables: `{{DATE}}` (today, YYYY-MM-DD),
  `{{NAMESPACES}}` (comma-separated list), `{{NAMESPACE}}` (single name),
  `{{NAMESPACE_LINKS}}` (formatted link list).
- REQ-782: The system SHALL create these pages:
  - Schema page (from `Schema.md` template)
  - Dashboard page (from `Dashboard.md` template)
  - One Hub page per namespace (from `Hub.md` template)
- REQ-783: For Logseq: all pages created flat in `pages/` directory with
  triple-underscore naming (`Wiki___Schema.md`, `Wiki___Tech.md`, etc.).
- REQ-784: For Obsidian: Schema and Dashboard in `Wiki/` directory.
  Hub pages in `Wiki/<Namespace>/_index.md` with directory creation.
- REQ-785: The system SHALL create parent directories as needed (`mkdir -p`).
- REQ-786: The system SHALL NOT overwrite existing pages. If a page already
  exists, the system SHOULD skip it with a warning.

### Step 9: Config File Generation

- REQ-790: The system SHALL create `llm-wiki.yml` in the wiki root directory.
- REQ-791: The config SHALL include all required keys: tool, wiki_path,
  pages_dir, namespaces. And memory_path if provided.
- REQ-792: The config SHALL include a header comment with generation date.

### Step 10: Skill Installation

- REQ-800: The system SHALL ask if the user wants to install the /llm-wiki skill
  for Claude Code.
- REQ-801: The user MAY enter a project path or "skip" to decline.
- REQ-802: If installing: copy `llm-wiki.md` to `$project/.claude/commands/llm-llm-wiki.md`,
  creating the directory if needed.
- REQ-803: The system SHALL patch the `<CONFIG_PATH>` placeholder in the
  copied skill file with the actual config file path using `sed`.
- REQ-804: The sed command MUST be platform-aware: macOS uses `sed -i ''`,
  Linux uses `sed -i`.

### Step 11: Initial Git Commit

- REQ-810: If git was initialized (Step 6) or `.git` already existed, the
  system SHALL create an initial commit with all created files.
- REQ-811: The commit message SHALL include: tool name, namespace count,
  and a link to the GitHub repository.
- REQ-812: Git errors during commit SHALL be suppressed (the commit is
  best-effort, not critical).

### Final Summary

- REQ-820: The system SHALL display a summary showing: wiki path, config
  file path, and 3 suggested next steps.
- REQ-821: The next steps SHALL include: open wiki in tool, try first ingest,
  run status command.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy path — Logseq, new directory, defaults

```
GIVEN python3 and git are available
WHEN the user runs ./setup.sh and:
    - Selects "1" (Logseq)
    - Enters "~/Documents/TestWiki" (does not exist)
    - Confirms "y" to create directory
    - Presses Enter for default namespaces
    - Enters "~/.claude/projects/test/memory/" for memory path
    - Confirms "y" for git init
    - Enters "~/myproject" for skill installation
THEN the system SHALL:
    - Create ~/Documents/TestWiki/pages/
    - Create 9 pages: Schema, Dashboard, 7 hub pages (one per default namespace)
    - Create llm-wiki.yml with all settings
    - Initialize git with .gitignore
    - Copy llm-wiki.md to ~/myproject/.claude/commands/llm-llm-wiki.md with patched config path
    - Create initial git commit
    - Display summary with next steps
```

### Scenario 2: Happy path — Obsidian, existing vault

```
GIVEN ~/Documents/ObsidianVault/ already exists with .obsidian/ directory
WHEN the user runs ./setup.sh and:
    - Selects "2" (Obsidian)
    - Enters "~/Documents/ObsidianVault"
    - Presses Enter for default namespaces
    - Skips memory path
    - git already initialized (.git exists)
    - Skips skill installation
THEN the system SHALL:
    - Create Wiki/ directory inside the vault
    - Create Schema.md and Dashboard.md in Wiki/
    - Create 7 namespace directories with _index.md hub pages
    - Create llm-wiki.yml (no memory_path)
    - Skip git init (already exists)
    - Create git commit with new files
    - Display summary
```

### Scenario 3: Directory does not exist — user declines creation

```
GIVEN the user enters wiki path "/nonexistent/path"
AND the path does not exist
WHEN the system asks "Create it? [y/n]"
AND the user enters "n"
THEN the system SHALL display an error message
AND exit with code 1
AND no files SHALL be created anywhere
```

### Scenario 4: Invalid tool selection

```
WHEN the user enters "3" for tool selection
THEN the system SHALL display: "Invalid choice"
AND exit with code 1
```

### Scenario 5: python3 not available

```
GIVEN python3 is not installed or not in PATH
WHEN setup.sh reaches the template rendering step
THEN the system SHALL fail with a python3-related error
AND no wiki pages SHALL be created
```

### Scenario 6: Template directory missing

```
GIVEN the templates/logseq/ directory does not exist
    (e.g., setup.sh run from wrong location)
WHEN setup.sh reaches template validation
THEN the system SHALL display an error about missing templates
AND exit with code 1
```

### Scenario 7: Skill installation skipped

```
WHEN the user enters "skip" for the skill installation prompt
THEN the system SHALL NOT copy llm-wiki.md anywhere
AND SHALL NOT modify any files outside the wiki directory
AND SHALL continue to the git commit step
```

### Scenario 8: Custom namespaces

```
WHEN the user enters "Engineering Sales Support" for namespaces
THEN the system SHALL create 3 hub pages:
    - Wiki___Engineering.md (Logseq) or Wiki/Engineering/_index.md (Obsidian)
    - Wiki___Sales.md or Wiki/Sales/_index.md
    - Wiki___Support.md or Wiki/Support/_index.md
AND the Schema page SHALL list these 3 namespaces
AND llm-wiki.yml SHALL contain these 3 namespaces
```

### Scenario 9: Git init skipped

```
GIVEN the wiki directory has no .git/
WHEN the system asks "Initialize git? [y/n]"
AND the user enters "n"
THEN no .git directory SHALL be created
AND no .gitignore SHALL be created
AND the final commit step SHALL be skipped
```

### Scenario 10: Existing pages not overwritten

```
GIVEN ~/Documents/Logseq/pages/Wiki___Schema.md already exists
    from a previous setup run
WHEN setup.sh runs template rendering
THEN the existing Schema page SHOULD NOT be overwritten
AND the system SHOULD display: "Wiki___Schema.md already exists, skipping"
```
