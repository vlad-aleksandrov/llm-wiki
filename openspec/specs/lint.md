# Spec: /llm-wiki lint — Automated Health Checks

## Description

The lint command scans all wiki pages for structural issues, data quality problems,
and security concerns. It reports findings grouped by severity and can auto-fix
certain issues when run with the `--fix` flag. There are 9 lint rules.

---

## Requirements

### Scanning

- REQ-100: The system SHALL scan ALL files matching the wiki page pattern
  (Logseq: `Wiki___*.md`, Obsidian: `Wiki/**/*.md`).
- REQ-101: The system SHALL read page properties, count outgoing `[[Wiki/...]]`
  links, and check the `updated::` date for every scanned page.
- REQ-102: The system SHALL build an incoming-link graph (page -> pages that
  reference it) to detect orphans.
- REQ-103: The system SHALL read `llm-wiki.yml` first to determine tool mode
  and paths.

### Rule 1: Orphan Detection

- REQ-110: The system SHALL flag pages with 0 incoming `[[Wiki/...]]` links
  from other wiki pages.
- REQ-111: Hub pages (type:: hub) SHALL be exempt from orphan detection.
- REQ-112: Auto-fix (--fix): The system SHALL add the orphan page to its
  namespace's hub page.

### Rule 2: Stale Detection

- REQ-120: The system SHALL flag pages where `updated::` is older than 90 days
  AND `confidence::` is `high`.
- REQ-121: Pages without a `confidence::` property SHALL be exempt from stale
  detection (the rule only applies to knowledge-type pages).
- REQ-122: The 90-day threshold SHALL be calculated as: today minus the
  `updated::` date value.
- REQ-123: Auto-fix (--fix): The system SHALL downgrade `confidence::` from
  `high` to `stale`. The `updated::` date SHALL NOT be changed by this
  operation (the page content has not changed, only the confidence assessment).

### Rule 3: Missing Properties

- REQ-130: The system SHALL check each page against the required properties for
  its declared `type::` value (per Schema page).
- REQ-131: Required properties per type:
  - Entity: type, entity-type, created, updated, status, source
  - Project: type, status, created, updated, started
  - Knowledge: type, domain, created, updated, confidence
  - Feedback: type, severity, created, verified, applies-to
  - Hub: type, namespace
- REQ-132: A page with a missing required property SHALL be flagged as a warning.
- REQ-133: No auto-fix for missing properties (requires human judgment).

### Rule 4: Broken References

- REQ-140: The system SHALL identify all `[[Wiki/...]]` links in every page and
  verify that the target page exists on disk.
- REQ-141: A link to a non-existent page SHALL be flagged as a warning.
- REQ-142: Auto-fix (--fix): The system SHALL create a stub page for each broken
  reference with: type:: knowledge, domain:: tech, confidence:: low,
  created:: [today], updated:: [today], and a placeholder note
  "To be filled via /llm-wiki ingest".
- REQ-143: Stub pages SHALL include a cross-reference back to the page that
  contained the broken link.

### Rule 5: Hub Completeness

- REQ-150: The system SHALL verify that every hub page lists ALL pages that exist
  in its namespace.
- REQ-151: A hub page missing a child page SHALL be flagged as a warning.
- REQ-152: Auto-fix (--fix): The system SHALL append the missing child page link
  to the hub page.

### Rule 6: Credential Leak

- REQ-160: The system SHALL scan all wiki page content for credential patterns:
  `token::`, `password::`, `secret::`, `api-key::`, `api.key::`, and base64
  strings matching `[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}`.
- REQ-161: Pattern matching SHALL be case-insensitive.
- REQ-162: In Obsidian mode, the system SHALL also scan YAML frontmatter for
  credential patterns.
- REQ-163: Any credential match SHALL be flagged as severity `critical`.
- REQ-164: No auto-fix for credential leaks (requires manual intervention to
  move the credential to L1 memory).

### Rule 7: Empty Pages

- REQ-170: The system SHALL flag pages that contain only properties and no
  substantive content below the properties section.
- REQ-171: A page with only type/date properties and no knowledge blocks SHALL
  be flagged as a warning.
- REQ-172: No auto-fix (page should be filled via /llm-wiki ingest or deleted).

### Rule 8: Cross-Reference Minimum

- REQ-180: The system SHALL flag pages with fewer than 1 outgoing `[[Wiki/...]]`
  link.
- REQ-181: Auto-fix (--fix): The system SHALL add a link to the page's namespace
  hub page (e.g., a page in Wiki/Tech/ gets a link to [[Wiki/Tech]]).

### Rule 9: L1/L2 Duplicates

- REQ-190: The system SHALL compare wiki page content against L1 memory files
  (at the path specified in `llm-wiki.yml` `memory_path`).
- REQ-191: The system SHALL flag cases where substantially the same information
  exists in both L1 memory and L2 wiki.
- REQ-192: No auto-fix (requires human decision on which location is authoritative).

### Reporting

- REQ-200: The system SHALL group findings by severity: critical, warning, info.
- REQ-201: The system SHALL output totals: total pages scanned, healthy pages,
  issues found (by rule and severity).
- REQ-202: For each finding, the system SHALL report: page name, rule violated,
  severity, and suggested fix.
- REQ-203: After auto-fix (--fix), the system SHALL output what was changed and
  recommend a git commit.

### Dashboard

- REQ-210: After lint completes, the system SHOULD update the Dashboard page
  (Wiki/Dashboard or Wiki___Dashboard.md) with current health metrics.
- REQ-211: The Dashboard SHALL include: last lint date, total pages, issues by
  severity, and pages needing attention.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Clean wiki — no issues

```
GIVEN a wiki with 10 pages, all with required properties, cross-references,
    and current updated:: dates
AND all hub pages list their children
AND no credential patterns exist in any page
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the report SHALL show: 10 pages scanned, 0 issues found
AND no pages SHALL be modified
```

### Scenario 2: Orphan page detected

```
GIVEN a page Wiki___Tech___Redis.md exists
AND no other wiki page contains a [[Wiki/Tech/Redis]] link
AND Redis is NOT a hub page
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the system SHALL flag Wiki/Tech/Redis as "orphan" (warning)
AND suggest: "Add [[Wiki/Tech/Redis]] to the Wiki/Tech hub page"
```

### Scenario 3: Orphan auto-fix

```
GIVEN the same orphan condition as Scenario 2
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint --fix
THEN the system SHALL append [[Wiki/Tech/Redis]] to Wiki___Tech.md
AND the report SHALL show: "Fixed: Added Wiki/Tech/Redis to hub Wiki/Tech"
```

### Scenario 4: Stale page with high confidence

```
GIVEN a page Wiki___Tech___Strapi.md with updated:: 2026-01-01
AND the page has confidence:: high
AND today is 2026-04-10 (100 days later, exceeds 90-day threshold)
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the system SHALL flag the page as "stale" (warning)
AND suggest: "Confidence is 'high' but page is 100 days old. Review or downgrade."
```

### Scenario 5: Stale auto-fix — confidence downgraded

```
GIVEN the same stale condition as Scenario 4
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint --fix
THEN the system SHALL change confidence:: from high to stale
AND the updated:: property SHALL remain 2026-01-01 (NOT changed)
AND the report SHALL show: "Fixed: Downgraded confidence from high to stale"
```

### Scenario 6: Credential leak detected

```
GIVEN a page Wiki___Tech___Deployment.md contains the text
    "api-key:: sk-ant-abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678"
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the system SHALL flag the page as "credential leak" (critical)
AND suggest: "Move credential to L1 memory. Wiki pages are git-tracked."
AND the finding SHALL be listed first in the report (critical severity)
```

### Scenario 7: Broken reference with auto-fix

```
GIVEN a page Wiki___Projects___MyProject.md contains [[Wiki/Tech/NewTool]]
AND no file Wiki___Tech___NewTool.md exists
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint --fix
THEN the system SHALL create a stub page Wiki___Tech___NewTool.md with:
    type:: knowledge, domain:: tech, confidence:: low, created:: [today],
    updated:: [today], and content "To be filled via /llm-wiki ingest"
AND the stub SHALL contain [[Wiki/Projects/MyProject]] as a cross-reference
AND the Wiki___Tech.md hub SHALL be updated to list the new page
```

### Scenario 8: Hub missing child pages

```
GIVEN Wiki___Tech.md (hub) lists: [[Wiki/Tech/Strapi]], [[Wiki/Tech/Stack]]
AND Wiki___Tech___Deployment.md also exists in the pages directory
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the system SHALL flag Wiki/Tech hub as "incomplete" (warning)
AND suggest: "Hub Wiki/Tech is missing child: [[Wiki/Tech/Deployment]]"
```

### Scenario 9: Empty page detected

```
GIVEN a page Wiki___Learning___Rust.md contains only:
    type:: knowledge
    domain:: tech
    created:: 2026-03-15
    updated:: 2026-03-15
    confidence:: low
AND no content blocks exist below the properties
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the system SHALL flag the page as "empty" (warning)
AND suggest: "Page has properties but no content. Fill via /llm-wiki ingest or delete."
```

### Scenario 10: L1/L2 duplicate detected

```
GIVEN L1 memory file feedback_deploy_ram.md contains "Stop ClamAV before deploy"
AND wiki page Wiki___Tech___Deployment.md also contains "Stop ClamAV before deploy"
WHEN the user runs /llm-wiki lint
THEN the system SHALL flag as "L1/L2 duplicate" (info)
AND suggest: "Same info in L1 memory and L2 wiki. Decide which is authoritative."
```
