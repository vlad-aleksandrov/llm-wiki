# Contributing to llm-wiki

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is young and contributions are welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — Something broken in `setup.sh`? Wiki pages not formatting correctly? Open an issue.
- **Feature requests** — Ideas for new `/llm-wiki` commands, lint rules, or template improvements? Open an issue.
- **Templates** — Better Schema designs, new page types, or improved hub pages.
- **Tool support** — Improvements to Logseq or Obsidian templates, or support for new tools.
- **Documentation** — Fixes, clarifications, or new guides.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-wiki.git`
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-change`
4. Make your changes
5. Test with `./setup.sh` (both Logseq and Obsidian modes)
6. Commit and push
7. Open a Pull Request

## Testing your changes

Before submitting a PR, test both modes:

```bash
# Logseq mode
echo -e "1\n/tmp/test-logseq\ny\n\nskip\ny\nskip" | ./setup.sh

# Obsidian mode
echo -e "2\n/tmp/test-obsidian\ny\n\nskip\ny\nskip" | ./setup.sh

# Verify output
ls /tmp/test-logseq/pages/Wiki___*.md
ls /tmp/test-obsidian/Wiki/
```

Clean up test directories after:
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/test-logseq /tmp/test-obsidian
```

## Guidelines

- Keep it simple. This tool should be understandable in 5 minutes.
- Templates must work in both Logseq and Obsidian (or clearly marked as tool-specific).
- No dependencies beyond `bash`, `python3`, and `git`. The setup script must run everywhere.
- Config file is always `llm-wiki.yml`.
- English for code, docs, and commit messages.
